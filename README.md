## OVERVIEW
The Java Advanced Management Console can be tricky to install.  Some of the
more important steps include:

1. Local or remote installation of a supported Relational Database (Oracle DB 
   or MySQL)

2. Installation of Oracle Fusion Middleware WebLogic application server

3. Deployment of the Java Advanced Management Console Java EE application

4. Configuration and integartion of these components.

This project contains an Installation Guide (MS-Word document) that walks you
through the steps, with screenshots included, needed to install the various
Java Advanced Management Console components.

This tag specifically contains an install guide for Java AMC 2.9 on Windows
(either desktop or server) with a MySQL database.  Additionally,  scripts 
are provided to ease the task of creating the necessary Windows services
that will start up the Java AMC components at boot time.
